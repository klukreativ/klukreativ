### <h1>Hi there 👋 I'm Karl</h1>

<h2>I'm a Guelph based Web Developer</h2>

I'm currently enrolled in Juno College of Technology (Cohort 44!) where I'm expanding on my previous knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JS, and React.js through my own projects and collaborating with others. I'm really excited to start my career in Web Development where I can hopefully design the new page or app you'll be using!

🔭 I’m currently working on an app called Drink O'Clock with my partner Joel. Drink O'Clock is a project where we're working with REST APIs to provide an interactive page where you can get a random drink, its ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare it based on your alcohol preference.

🕹️ When I'm not coding, I'm an avid fan of:
  <br/>• Dungeons & Dragons (particularly AD&D & 2ED) and other tabletop RPGs
  <br/>• Tabletop Skirmish Wargames (currently invested in Infinity and Dark Age)
  <br/>• Isometric RPGs where my choices count
  <br/>• Open world RPGs where I can waste inordinate amounts of time crafting and building things
