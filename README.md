### <h1>Hi there 👋 I'm Karl</h1>

<h2>I'm a Guelph based Web Developer</h2>

I'm a recent Juno College of Technology graduate (Cohort 44!) where I've expanded on my previous knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JS, and React.js through my own projects and collaborating with others. I'm really excited to start my career in Web Development where I can hopefully design the new page or app you'll be using!

<br/>
🔭 I’m currently looking for careers and opportunities within the web development field while continuing to hone my craft (refactoring previous projects and learning TypeScript)
<br/><br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning to use my current skills in HTML5, CSS3, JS, and React.js in a more collaborative effort.
<br/><br/>
🌠 I'm looking for my first fulltime gig after I graduate bootcamp where I can join a team that will help me continue to grow and develop. Shoot me a DM if you have one you'd like to share!
<br/><br/>
🤔 I'm interested in learning more about TypeScript, the MERN stack, C#, .NET, and the Blazor framework.
<br/><br/>
🪟 I'm a lover of all things Microsoft, especially Surface products and XBOX.
<br/><br/>
🕹️ When I'm not coding, I'm an avid fan of:
<ul>
<li>Dungeons & Dragons (particularly AD&D & 2ED - Dark Sun & Al Qadim) and other tabletop RPGs</li>
<li>Tabletop Skirmish Wargames (currently invested in Infinity and Dark Age)</li>
<li>Isometric RPGs where my choices count</li>
<li>Open world RPGs where I can waste inordinate amounts of time crafting and building things</li>
</ul>
